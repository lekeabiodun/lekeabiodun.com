            <h1>Hi there, <span class="whitespace-nowrap">I'm Leke Abiodun.</span></h1>
            <p>I love writing codes that solve unique problems and create solutions that drive business growth, I'm a
                performance-driven and motivated Full-Stack Developer.
                PHP is no longer sucks! These days you will mostly find me building web applications with PHP, Laravel,
                Livewire, AlpineJS and TailwindCSS.
            </p>
            <p>One of the most exciting developments in recent time is the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), which
                has revolutionised how we interact with machines and solve problems. Ai is mind blowing and this has
                become one of my favorite hobbies.</p>
            <p>Some interesting projects I've worked on include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>FinTech</li>
                <li>Payroll system</li>
                <li>Job recruitment portal</li>
                <li>E-Commerce rental place</li>
                <li>School management system</li>
                <li>Thrift collection management</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I love technology, when I'm not coding you will mostly find me with my love ones or discussing and
                teaching about technology, software, negotiation, productivity, music etc.</p>
