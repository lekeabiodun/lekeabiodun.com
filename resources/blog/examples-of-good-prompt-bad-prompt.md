# 11 examples of good prompts.

When you talk to an AI chatbot, how you ask your question really matters. A thoughtful, well-written prompt leads to better answers. But a sloppy, confusing prompt gives you useless or silly replies.

I made this blog to showcase prompts done right and done wrong across many examples. Comparing good and bad prompts teaches how to talk to chatbots the best way.
